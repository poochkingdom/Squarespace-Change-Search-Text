# Squarespace-Change-Search-Text
jQuery Script to change the placeholder text in a Squarespace search page

A small script that will allow you to change the default text in the search page. Requires jQuery script to be included somewhere in the page or site code.

I'm providing a standard version of the script, and a minified version.
