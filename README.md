# Squarespace-Change-Search-Text
jQuery Script to change the placeholder text in a Squarespace search page

A small script that will allow you to change the default text in the search page. Requires jQuery script to be included somewhere in the page or site code.

I'm providing a standard version of the script, and a minified version.

For the traditional Squarespace search page, you have to include this code in the head or footer, so it would be called every time a page loads. I added a check the pathname to ensure the jQuery code only runs if you're on the correct page. So, you must change the pathname and the search text for your own implementation.
